# Dixit

2020 has been an interesting year so far. In March, the company I worked for decided that they would stop working with all outside contractors. Since I had some extra time on my hands then, I figured I'll use it to learn Firebase.

My friends and I got together on zoom every day during lockdown and the following months. Someone suggested we play a game during those zoom sessions. Dixit was fun but there are no good Apps which we could use to play it. The people behind the board game are building a mobile game but so far that's still in private beta. I put two and two together and decided I'll build a realtime web based card game to learn Firebase. Here we are now.

There's still a lot of work to be done on the project but it's playable. The cards aren't in the repo due to copyright but if you're reading this so you can set the game up for yourself, you can do what we did - we bought the cards, scanned them and then uploaded all of them to firestore.

There's been a UI redesign which still needs to be coded out and I've made an insane amount of mistakes during the development process that I'd like to fix. That's the short term roadmap. I don't have a timeframe for that yet but here's me hoping that I can get to writing some actual docs once I build out the redesign. Oh yeah, and there are 0 tests...
